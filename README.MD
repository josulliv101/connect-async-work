#### Goals (still in progress)

- Be able to cancel requests
- Delay router transitions or be able to display 'is loading' cmp
- Work on server side
- Nested async routes
- React Fiber, only reconcile a sub-tree at times/shut down static parts of tree on async render
- Dynamic keys in store (i.e. include a param id from match in a key)
- Material-UI
